# Sinatra Skeleton

Application skeleton using Sinatra.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/rapind/sinatra-skeleton.git shiny-new-app
cd shiny-new-app
bundle
rm -rf .git
git init .
git add .
git commit -am "Initial Commit"
```
## Running
Usually you'll want two shells open. One for rack and another for guard. You could alternatively run either or both in the background, but I prefer having them both open while I work.

Shell 1
```
rackup
```

Shell 2
```
guard
```
